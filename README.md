# BME808 - Computations in Genetic Engineering

## Lab 2 - Introduction to Python
This lab explores foundational code of python, specifically for genetic engineering and bioinformatic applications, by practicing reading and processing DNA sequences from FASTA files.

## Lab 3 - Assembly of Sequence Data
This lab delves into the understanding of sequence DNA data and genomic assembly using Python. Through guided Python exercises, a function was implemented to compute the largest overlap between two sequences, extended to generate an overlap matrix for multiple fragments, and then applied within a greedy assembly algorithm to determine an optimal path connecting all fragments.
